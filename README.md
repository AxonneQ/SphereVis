## Description
Simply: A Sphere that visualises music.

Sounds simple, but it requires a lot of maths! 

First inspiration came from a WebGL globe. I want my sphere to shoot out hexagonal pillars depending on audio frequency.

I would love to create something like that but on a hollow sphere, made of hexagons like so:

Once the sphere is made from hundreds of hexagons, and working, then the next step will be to add background waves like those:

When those 3 things are combined together, it will look interesting when looking how it reacts to music. I also plan to add a lot of lighting effects and transitions.

## Challenges
Maths.. lot's of maths in every aspect of this project. 
Time management, I'm hoping to achieve what I can within the little time we have between all assignments and FYP project.
Learning Unity. Labs are great, but this will be the real challenge.
